# Restaurant Management System

## Overview

This is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project designed to simulate a Restaurant Management System.The system provides
functionalities for managing restaurant operations, including customers, employees, food items, and menus. It is built using 
Python and demonstrates core OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

## Features

### 1. Admin Module

- Manage overall operations of the restaurant.
- Access and modify restaurant data such as menus, employees, and customers.

### 2. Customer Module

- Handles customer information.
- Allows customers to view menus and place orders.

### 3. Employee Module

- Manages employee details.
- Provides an interface for employees to interact with the system.

### 4. Menu Management

- Add, update, and delete food items.
- View food menus categorized by type or availability.

### 5. Food Item Management

- Add new food items to the system.
- Update prices, descriptions, and availability status.

### 6. User Authentication

- Handles user authentication for admin and employees.
- Ensures secure access to different levels of functionality.

### 7. Main Application

- `main.py` serves as the entry point for the application.
- Provides a unified interface for interacting with the system.
